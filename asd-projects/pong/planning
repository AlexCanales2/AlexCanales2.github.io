User Story / Gameplay
Describe the gameplay
You have two different walls and a ball in the middle and it goes from left to right and bounces, if you miss it when you control the wall then you will lose a point and if they miss you gain one
What are the conditions when the game begins? 
You both have 0 points
Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
Once one team has 10 points 
What ifs will there be?
if the game goes on for too long then the ball will speed up
Visual Game Components:
What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
The pong ball is a picture of me and the boxes wil be my friends (just like bouncing box)
What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
I will use the same values except for board1X, board2x, and boxX
Events / Logic
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
There will be a minute long timer between each point and then it starts to go faster every 10 seconds
How do those events affect the data of the program?
A lot of coidng has to be done as it wont be just moving the boxes but also adjusting the speed of the box or others
For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
